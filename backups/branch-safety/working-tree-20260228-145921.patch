 # Task Plan Tracking Log
 
+## Task Plan - 2026-02-28 - Unmerged Branch and PR Triage
+
+### Current Focus
+- Determine which branches not merged into `main` are intentional archives vs. merge candidates, and define a safe merge path for active work.
+
+### Plan
+- [x] Inventory remote branches not merged into `origin/main`.
+- [x] Map each unmerged branch to PR status (`open`/`closed`/none).
+- [x] Calculate divergence (`ahead/behind`) and inspect tip commit intent for each branch.
+- [x] Produce initial merge recommendation by branch class (`archive/*`, `backup*`, `wip*`, feature branch).
+- [x] Confirm source-of-truth branch for chat transparency work (`origin/feat/chat-thinking-transparency` vs PR #34 fork head).
+- [x] Run merge-readiness checks on PR #34 candidate tip (CI status, required checks, targeted local verification).
+- [x] Execute chosen action: merge PR #34, request changes, or close/defer; then clean up stale remote branches by policy.
+
+### Review
+- Unmerged remote branches detected: `21`; local unmerged branches: `0`.
+- PR mapping:
+  - `20` branches have `NO_PR` and all are archive/backup/wip prefixed branches.
+  - `1` branch name maps to an open PR: `feat/chat-thinking-transparency` -> `#34` (`open`).
+- Critical divergence detail for active work:
+  - `origin/feat/chat-thinking-transparency` tip SHA: `89a5db07a138a70023fc2658ddaba5f9bc02847d`.
+  - PR #34 head SHA: `304dc131b624289d3fccc69eeba203af3f8b7ebb`.
+  - PR head is `2` commits ahead of the `origin/*` branch with same name.
+- PR #34 source-of-truth delta identified:
+  - `304dc13 chore: checkpoint pending workspace changes` (broad mixed-scope checkpoint commit).
+  - `40dcaba fix(gates): fail closed backend runtime source-of-truth diff` (targeted gate fix).
+- Merge-readiness gate status:
+  - Main branch protection reports no required checks configured (`protected: false`, required checks empty), so local verification discipline is required before merge.
+  - PR #34 reports `mergeable_state=unstable` and has unresolved review threads; direct merge is currently blocked by branch-governance policy.
+- Chosen action executed:
+  - Deferred direct merge of PR #34.
+  - Created clean integration worktree and branch from `origin/feat/chat-thinking-transparency`: `/tmp/lawglance-pr34-sanitized` on `prep/pr34-sanitized-gate-fix`.
+  - Cherry-picked only commit `40dcaba` (gate hardening) and excluded checkpoint commit `304dc13`.
+  - Trialed first selective-recovery path (`backup-stash-us007` -> `recovery/us007-domain-leak-scanner`); direct cherry-pick of `ad7a904` produced add/add overlap conflicts, indicating partial integration drift and requiring semantic diff recovery instead of replay.
+- Verification environment blocker captured:
+  - `uv` is unavailable in the isolated worktree shell.
+  - Repo `scripts/venv_exec.sh` validation cannot run there because `.venv` is absent.
+  - Targeted lint/tests for sanitized branch remain pending until a Python 3.11 toolchain/venv is provisioned.
+- No-loss safeguards completed:
+  - Created recoverable backup bundle: `backups/branch-safety/unmerged-branches-2026-02-28.bundle`.
+  - Created ref/sha manifest: `backups/branch-safety/unmerged-branches-2026-02-28.manifest.tsv`.
+  - Verified bundle integrity: `backups/branch-safety/unmerged-branches-2026-02-28.bundle.verify.txt`.
+  - Published branch-by-branch governance decisions in `docs/release/2026-02-28-unmerged-branch-governance-audit.md`.
+  - Published selective commit recovery queue in `docs/release/2026-02-28-branch-recovery-backlog.md`.
+- Recommendation snapshot:
+  - `archive/*`, `archive/backup-*`, `archive/wip-*`: treat as archival snapshots; do not merge into `main`.
+  - `feat/chat-thinking-transparency`: only active merge candidate branch lineage.
+  - `pr/34-head`: defer direct merge until checkpoint commit is removed/split and verification reruns pass.
