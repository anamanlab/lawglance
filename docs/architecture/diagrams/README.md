# Architecture Diagrams

This directory contains visual representations of the IMMCAD system architecture. These diagrams help provide a high-level overview of component relationships, data flow, and module dependencies.

## Module Dependency Diagram

The file `generated-module-dependencies.mmd` is a Mermaid diagram that illustrates the internal structure and dependencies between Python modules. It is automatically generated by analyzing Python imports across the `src/` directory.

### Maintenance and Generation

To ensure the diagram remains accurate as the codebase evolves, it should be regenerated whenever significant structural changes are made to the modules.

Regenerate the diagram using the provided script:

```bash
python scripts/generate_module_dependency_diagram.py
```

### Usage

- **Discovery**: Use this diagram to understand which modules are tightly coupled.
- **Onboarding**: Helps new developers visualize how different parts of the backend interact.
- **Refactoring**: Identify cyclic dependencies or oversized modules that might benefit from decoupling.

> **Note**: Do not manually edit files ending in `.mmd` as they are subject to automated updates.
