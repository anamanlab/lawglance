# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-02-23

## Codebase Patterns
- Run `make quality` before each commit.
- Keep architecture docs in sync when changing API contracts or runtime behavior.
- Canada-only legal scope is mandatory; avoid India-domain terms outside legacy archival files.

- Implemented a dedicated India-domain leak scanner script with Canada-scope defaults, explicit allowlist handling, and non-zero exit on violations with file/line output.
- Files changed: scripts/scan_domain_leaks.py, tests/test_domain_leak_scanner.py, scripts/ralph/prd.json, scripts/ralph/progress.txt.
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Reusable pattern: Keep scanner logic testable via a `main(argv)` entrypoint plus pure scanning helpers.
  - Gotcha: `importlib`-loaded test modules that use `@dataclass` must be added to `sys.modules` before `exec_module`.
  - Useful context: Current repo has approved India-term references in migration-history docs and jurisdiction-evaluation modules, so explicit path allowlisting is required.
