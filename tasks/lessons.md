# Lessons Learned

## Session Notes
- No user correction patterns recorded yet for this task.
- User clarified to continue step-by-step in a multi-agent dirty worktree and ignore unrelated concurrent edits.
- Review feedback highlighted that archive module path changes must also preserve internal importability after root-shim removals.
- Reviewer-identified P1 mismatch confirmed a key risk: hardened-environment alias rules must be shared consistently between backend and frontend runtime codepaths.
- Case-law chat integration work exposed a policy coupling: tool-generated official court citations can be dropped unless trusted-domain defaults include official feed hosts.
- User correction (2026-02-25): E2E setup must be resilient on headless servers and use Context7 documentation when requested.
- User correction (2026-02-25): For UI redesign requests, default implementation target to the active modern frontend (`frontend-web`) and verify before touching legacy Streamlit UI.
- User correction (2026-02-26): Never run `apply_patch` through `exec_command`; always use the dedicated `apply_patch` tool for file edits.
- User correction (2026-02-27): When asked to parallelize, immediately fan out independent verification/review tracks with spawned agents and keep them running concurrently until convergence.
- User correction (2026-02-27): Reviewer findings on compilation contracts must be resolved end-to-end across backend readiness semantics and frontend payload rendering/mapping, not as isolated one-file fixes.
- User correction (2026-02-27): Cloudflare is the active platform; avoid framing Vercel as primary deployment/runtime and migrate operational env defaults to Cloudflare-first paths.
- Incident pattern (2026-02-27): Cloudflare Tunnel outages surfaced as raw `530` HTML in chat flows; proxy layer must normalize tunnel `1033` failures into structured JSON errors with trace ids.
- Incident recovery pattern (2026-02-27): keep an explicit emergency fallback origin variable (`IMMCAD_API_BASE_URL_FALLBACK`) for chat path retries so primary tunnel outages do not become total frontend chat outages.
- Incident recovery pattern (2026-02-27): fallback-origin retries for POST routes require replay-safe body buffering; do not rely on one-shot request streams when implementing retry/failover.
- User correction (2026-02-27): prompt-improvement iterations must include user-facing friendliness for social greetings, explicit capability/tool-orchestration disclosure, and measurable behavior-eval coverage (not prompt text changes only).
- User correction (2026-02-27): when production hardening is requested, pair prompt updates with runtime observability fields so greeting/constrained behavior can be monitored after deploy.
- User correction (2026-02-27): when users report frontend workflow errors, validate proxy-forwarded protocol/client headers against backend middleware gates before treating it as a source outage.
- User correction (2026-02-28): when asked for frontend/backend confusion analysis, move beyond high-level size-based findings and provide quantified contract/runtime drift evidence plus concrete UX state-transition root causes before proposing a plan.

## Reusable Rules
- Verify every legal-source claim with a directly tested endpoint or official policy page.
- Separate technical feasibility from legal permission in documentation.
- In shared/dirty worktrees, scope edits tightly to requested files and avoid touching unrelated agent changes.
- When enforcing hardened runtime config, mirror requirements in CI env blocks and workflow tests in the same change.
- For Vercel backend releases, avoid stale local `--prebuilt` artifacts unless they are freshly generated and audited; prebuilt manifests can pin deprecated runtimes and reference local `.env` files.
- For Vercel official Python runtime pinning, prefer project-root `.python-version` (or `pyproject.toml`) over forcing `functions.runtime` strings in `vercel.json`.
- When migrating modules into an archive package, convert internal imports to package-relative imports and add regression tests before removing root compatibility modules.
- When splitting modules and updating package `__init__` exports, ensure newly imported files are tracked/included in the same patch to avoid `ModuleNotFoundError` on clean checkouts.
- For optional auth configuration, gate middleware enforcement on the presence of a configured secret (not just request path) and add tests for both configured and unset modes.
- Keep exactly one active "Current Focus" plan block at the top of `tasks/todo.md`; archive or delete duplicate active-plan sections to avoid conflicting execution signals.
- If GitHub Issues are disabled, maintain a repo-local known-issues log in `docs/release/` with owners, severity, and status so production risks still have a canonical tracker.
- Close or reuse spawned agents after each major workstream; orphaned agent threads can hit the session cap and block parallel explorer workflows.
- In dirty multi-agent worktrees, scanning gates that enforce repository policy should default to tracked files only to avoid unrelated untracked artifacts creating false release blockers.
- Do not run frontend `typecheck` and `build` in parallel when `.next/types` is included in TypeScript config; run typecheck after build or serially to avoid transient missing-file errors.
- When introducing environment hardening wildcard support, enforce one canonical matcher pattern across backend settings, backend runtime behavior, frontend runtime config, and tests.
- When adding new retrieval/tool citation sources, update default trust policy and regression tests in the same PR so valid citations are not silently downgraded.
- For high-risk actions like document export, convert client-only approval flags into server-issued signed approval artifacts (short-lived tokens) at least in hardened environments.
- When users report intermittent frontend "Unexpected error" behavior in Next.js dev mode, check for `.next` module-cache corruption (`Cannot find module './*.js'`) and restart dev after rotating stale `.next` cache.
- For debugability and support operations, ensure frontend failure paths always surface a non-empty trace identifier (proxy header or client-generated fallback) instead of "Trace ID: Unavailable".
- For Playwright on headless Linux servers, default local project selection to Chromium/Firefox/Mobile Chrome and keep WebKit/Safari as explicit opt-in or CI jobs that install dependencies with `playwright install --with-deps`.
- When asked to use Context7, resolve the library first and anchor setup decisions in retrieved docs before implementing config changes.
- Do not return synthetic scaffold case-search results when backend case services are unreachable; surface structured `SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE` errors so users are not misled by non-exportable fake cases.
- Do not enable frontend chat scaffold fallback implicitly; require explicit env opt-in so backend misconfiguration is visible instead of silently masked.
- For user-facing case-search failures, map structured validation/policy errors to actionable UI guidance instead of generic "temporarily unavailable" copy.
- For mixed case-law + document workflows, never reuse case-law status copy in document error banners; route workflow banner text by failing endpoint.
- For greeting/friendliness improvements, include locale-aware handling (`en-CA`/`fr-CA`) and tests that verify mixed greeting+legal prompts still follow legal grounding paths.
- In dual-service chat + case-search UIs, always show whether displayed results correspond to the current query or a previous query to prevent stale-context confusion.
- If subagent spawn fails due thread-cap limits, do not stall implementation; report the limit once, continue sequential execution, and close any known agent IDs as soon as they are no longer needed.
- For user-requested acceleration, default to parallel subagents for independent test/review/planning tasks instead of serial execution.
- When backend response contracts evolve (for example object vs string summary shapes or renamed keys), update frontend runtime mapping, TypeScript payload types, and contract tests in the same change.
- For compilation/readiness pipelines with selectable profiles, compute readiness against the resolved profile requirements rather than forum defaults.
- For Cloudflare cutovers, always record Worker version IDs, check custom-domain DNS from public resolvers (`1.1.1.1`/`8.8.8.8`), and keep a `workers.dev` fallback path active until 24h observation evidence is captured.
- Before any production deploy sequence, run an explicit clean-worktree preflight (`make release-preflight`) so migration evidence is not mixed with unrelated local edits.
- For Cloudflare Python Worker rollouts, keep migration staged: land scaffold + workflow tests first, then validate with authenticated perf smoke (`make backend-cf-perf-smoke`) before attempting full traffic cutover.
- Always run at least one real canary deploy attempt after scaffolding; local tests can pass while platform limits (for example Cloudflare Worker bundle-size `code: 10027`) block production viability.
- When reporting a production blocker to the user, implement at least one concrete mitigation in the same pass (for example a preflight gate, safer fallback path, or runbook check), not just a diagnosis.
- When launching long-lived local services/tunnels from tool-managed non-interactive shells, do not rely on plain background `nohup` alone; use a detached session mode (`setsid`) or persistent TTY/tmux/systemd supervision and verify the child PIDs remain alive from a fresh shell after the launcher exits.
- During Cloudflare DNS/tunnel cutovers, local resolver propagation can lag behind public resolvers; gate cutover on reachability using public DNS answers plus `curl --resolve` fallback rather than local resolver-only checks.
- For `cloudflared` named-tunnel systemd services, prefer `--token-file` over `--token` so tunnel tokens do not appear in `ps` output or `systemctl status`.
- `cloudflared --token-file` can reject otherwise-readable files depending on ownership/mode expectations; on this host it worked with a runtime-user-owned token file (`ec2-user:ec2-user`, `0600`) and failed with a root-owned group-readable file.
- Installer/preflight scripts for live tunnel rollouts should retry public health checks (short backoff) to tolerate brief tunnel reconnect windows during service restarts.
- When wrapping synchronous service calls with `run_in_threadpool`, keep explicit `ApiError` handling in the route; otherwise `RateLimitError`/`SourceUnavailableError` can leak as raw 500s.
- During edge-proxy migrations, keep error envelope and trace-header contracts aligned with frontend parsing (`error.code` + `trace_id` + `x-trace-id`) and maintain temporary client-side fallback for legacy proxy shapes.
- For architecture confusion audits, include at least one measurable parity check (for example deploy/runtime source sync) and one behavior-level UX check (state transitions, auto-switching, or hidden mode changes) before final recommendations.
- For lawyer-research `source_status`, avoid hardcoded official source-id lists; prefer registry-driven classification so new official case-law sources are not misreported as unknown.
- Treat edge proxy contract checks as a preflight gate (script + CI workflow step), not just a unit test, so release/deploy paths fail fast when worker headers/envelope drift from frontend expectations.
- When a user explicitly requests interactive CLI setup/auth in a remote Codespace, execute the interactive flow first (and show live status) before proposing token-based automation; only pivot after proving callback constraints or completing the interactive step.
- If the user says the runtime path is Cloudflare-only and not Vercel, use Vercel only as a secret-recovery source (if needed) and avoid proposing Vercel deploys as a primary fix path.
- For Cloudflare-only operations, enforce explicit `ENVIRONMENT`/`IMMCAD_ENVIRONMENT` values in Wrangler/runtime config and validate them in CI.
- Treat Cloudflare Tunnel `1033`/`530` responses as provider-source outages at the proxy boundary and convert them into stable API error envelopes (`503`) instead of forwarding raw HTML.
- For critical chat availability, support a bounded fallback-origin retry path in frontend proxy routing and expose a response marker header when fallback is used.
- When expanding failover across API routes, scope fallback paths explicitly and validate each route live after deploy; fallback availability can differ by endpoint even on the same backend.
- Never invoke `apply_patch` via shell execution; use the direct patch tool so edits remain deterministic and policy-compliant.
