# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-02-23

## Codebase Patterns
- Run `make quality` before each commit.
- Keep architecture docs in sync when changing API contracts or runtime behavior.
- Canada-only legal scope is mandatory; avoid India-domain terms outside legacy archival files.
- Use small, single-owner stories and validate with targeted tests before moving to the next story.

- Verified and accepted the pre-existing domain-leak scanner implementation for Canada scope (`scripts/scan_domain_leaks.py`) and its tests, then completed Ralph bookkeeping for the story.
- Files changed
- `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- `scripts/ralph/progress.txt`
- Learnings for future iterations:
- Reusable pattern: Validation scripts are implemented as importable Python modules with a small `main()` entrypoint plus direct unit tests using `importlib`.
- Gotcha: `make` is not installed in this environment, so run the `quality` target commands manually in `Makefile` order and record that equivalence in progress.
- Useful context: `US-001` code already exists on `ralph/canada-hardening-next-loop` (`scripts/scan_domain_leaks.py`, `tests/test_domain_leak_scanner.py`) and passed the full quality gate.
